    <p class="col">For Mike Bloomberg, the one-way conversation with Democratic voters is about to end.

        By spending more than $400 million of his own money and largely bypassing his opponents by skipping the early
        primary states, Bloomberg has rocketed to double-digit support in enough national polls to qualify for both
        [tonight’s] Nevada debate and next week’s debate in South Carolina.

        But as Bloomberg’s support has risen, so has the criticism from his Democratic foes as well as the broader
        scrutiny of his past comments and record as New York City mayor. As he faces his rivals onstage for the first
        time, they’ve made it clear they’re eager to take him on. …

        It will be the first time he’s debated in over a decade. And the first time in this campaign that Bloomberg will
        have to answer before a national audience for racial and sexist comments he’s made in the past. Mark Green, the
        former New York City public advocate who ran against Bloomberg for mayor in 2001, says that could be tough.</p>

        While Bloomberg is appearing on the debate stage in Nevada, he still is not participating in Saturday’s
        state
        caucus. He’s skipping the first four voting states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — in
        favor
        of focusing on the multitude of states that vote March 3, Super Tuesday.
